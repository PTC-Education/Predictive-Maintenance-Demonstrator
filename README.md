# Predictive-Maintenance-Demonstrator
Includes the software and tutorials for the Predictive Maintenance Demonstrator project.

## Goal of the project:
This project is intended to serve as a foundation for students and new users of Thingworx ANalytics to gain a basic understanding of the analytics platform as well as the implementation of predictive maintenance projects. The hardware used is an inexpensive robot arm that can be easily replicated. The use of real hardware is intended to provide a reference to the data used, as opposed to the often arbitrary data sets provided for training.
